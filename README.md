# True-Home
Carring beyond retirement
True-Home is a nursing home project created for family to find a perfect retirement homes across the USA.  With over 15000 locations across the US True-Home is a one stop shop for your retirement home search.  As an analyst with a background in Education and technicall skills gained from Rice University.  My passion for using data to make a meaningful impact led me to create this website, designed to assist families in finding the perfect retirement homes for their loved ones.  The interactive map was created by using geomapping allowing users to locate nursing homes based on rating, state, and city.  
# How did I create True-Home?
These are the steps that brought this project to life, and I hope you find it both informative and inspiring.
## Project idea
I embared on this project motivated by a strong desire to help families in finding the ideal nursing home and to discover the best retirement homes.  I utilized geomapping Leaflet.js to map out all nursing homes, enabling users to explore numerous options seamlessly.
## Data cleaning
To clean and structure a complex dataset I used Python.  This involved tasks like handling missing values, removie duplicates, and ensuring data accuracy and consistency.  Python's versatility and libraries were instrumental in preparing the dta for further analysis.
## ETL with pgAdmin SQL
I employed pgAdmin SQL for efficient data extraction, transformation and loading (ETL).  SQL queries were used for ETL in a PostreSQL database, ensuring data integrity and acessibility, laying the foundation for the project's next phases.  
## Building API for Data Accessibility
I designed and developed a custom API to facilitate secure and efficient data retrieval, enabling seamless sharing of valuable insights with external applications and users.  This pivotal step enhanced the project's functionality and data-driven capabilities.
## Backend Development
In the project's back-end developent phase, I utilized the power of JavaScript to create a robust and responsive platform.  JavaScript provided the interactivity and functionality required to support the project's objectives.  
## Front-end development
I modified html5 up template to structure web pages and leveraged CSS and Sass to create a visually appealing and consistent styles for the application.  This combination of tecn resulted in a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrated with the project's data-driven features.
